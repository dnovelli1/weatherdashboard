# Weather Dashboard

## In this assignment the ask was to build a weather dashboard where a user can enter in a city name and be provided with the forecast for that day and the 5 day forecast. In order to complete this assignment I ahd to start by acquiring an API from openweathermap.org. Then I needed to sort my way through the API to find the exact responses that I wanted to display for the user. I used Bootstrap to construct the page's layout and set cards for each section. The more exposure to the libraries is vyer good because I can find new things to format ideas and find my taste in customization. This assignment was again very challenging and time consuming, but worth the learning experience. I feel that with time, this will become second nature.



## Technology I Put to Work
- GitHub - repository storage for the project in order to amke changes, deploy them and push to a main branch. 

- GitBash - used for written commands and communicating witht he repository stored on GitHub.

- HTML - used to create and edit electronic documents stored on the web.

- Javascript - a programming language used to create specific events and make your website pop to viewers.
    - Conditional Statements
    - Local Storage
    - Functions

    - Event Listeners
    - Selectors
